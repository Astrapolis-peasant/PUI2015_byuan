+ The plot is relatively easy to read.

+ Esthetically, the fonts could be bigger and the graph could be bigger because the line overlaps with the legend.

+ The title could be more clear because I do not know what kind of topic for age is by just reading the topic.

+ I would say the plot is honest and no deforming here.

+ I think the plot is clear and readable enough.
