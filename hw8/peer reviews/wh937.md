+ I thought that the plot was supposed to be made with data that was used for pui homework, it is a very interesting topic though.

+ The plot is relatively easy to read. However, due to the topic of this graph, I thought it would be easier to understand in 2D instea

+ The title is clear. 

+ I think the plot is clear and readable enough.
