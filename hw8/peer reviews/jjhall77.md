+ I thought that the plot was supposed to be made with data that was used for civic project, it is a very interesting topic though.

+ The plot is relatively easy to read. However, the colors of the points are not clear to be distinguished. Ande is it better to have linear lines to better demonstrate the trend.

+ Esthetically, I wish to have dotted lines between each interval so I can better tell where each point locate. 

+The title is clear. 

+ I think the plot is clear and readable enough.
