# About this Assignment 3

***

## Environment
All essential packages are included in Anaconda except for ggplot.
ggplot can be installed by simply running the following command in the terminal:

		pip install ggplot

Otherwise, one can comment that line and the program should still go through.

The data file should be stored under the same as the python script.

## Data
The data we used is citibike's May 2015 data. For the other datasets, it should also be able to be analyzed through this script. 

## My Contibution
I participated in the brainstorming about forming the idea and turnning it to the null hypothesis. After we wrote our script, I used this script for another dataset.


## Conclution
 Althrough our hypothesis that customer is more likely to use the bike for longer time is proven right. Due to the skewness, it is not fully tested due the limit of the data.
